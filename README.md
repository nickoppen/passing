This is a short project to check out two things:

- A simple profiling mechanism using e_ctimers from within the kernel (ignoring load times),
- basic coprthr synchronisation and
- A couple of ways of passing data between cores using direct memory writes and mpi messages.

This is currently a work in progress so don't expect anything to work.
